# Installation

## QBCore / ESX

### qb-clothing
1. Open client/main.lua,
2. Find this block: 

```
if v.type == "face" then
    maxModelValues[k].item = 45
    maxModelValues[k].texture = 15
end

if v.type == "face2" then
    maxModelValues[k].item = 45
    maxModelValues[k].texture = 15
end
```

3. Replace it with:

```
if v.type == "face" then
    maxModelValues[k].item = 100
    maxModelValues[k].texture = 15
end

if v.type == "face2" then
    maxModelValues[k].item = 100
    maxModelValues[k].texture = 15
end
```

### illenium-appearance

1. Open game/customization.lua,
2. Find this block: 

```
shapeFirst = {
    min = 0,
    max = 45
},
shapeSecond = {
    min = 0,
    max = 45
},
shapeThird = {
    min = 0,
    max = 45
},
```

3. Replace it with:

```
shapeFirst = {
    min = 0,
    max = 100

shapeSecond = {
    min = 0,
    max = 100
},
shapeThird = {
    min = 0,
    max = 100
},
```

### QBox crm

1. Open crm-appearance/crm-config.lua,
2. Find this block: 

```
crm_config.crm_faces_max = 45 -- Default: 45
```

3. Replace it with:

```
crm_config.crm_faces_max = 100 -- Default: 45
```

## vRP/Custom

### For vRP or other custom frameworks, please reach out via Discord for assistance. Custom implementation support is provided based on your system's structure and my own knowledge, but ultimately you are the one who knows your framework best.

## Notes

- Be sure your server had started the resource and that you had adjusted the required scripts.
- Some older scripts may not respect the new values without additional tweaking.
- Always test character creation thoroughly after modifying appearance scripts.
